# Bird's Eye View
Hello all, I'm Aslesh Sura and this is my project, **Bird's Eye View**. I will be sharing the schematics to my PCBs and any 3D Parts made for this project.

# How I found my Project Idea
I regularly feed birds in my Patio, for the atleast the past year. And, this has attracted a lot of birds to visit throughout the day. One day, when my friend came over, I realized that others didn't have the same opportunity as me to see a bird calmly eating food, which inspired me to create this project. With **Bird's Eye View**, I will host a GitHub Page through which people can access Daily Photos of Birds living in Austin, Texas.
